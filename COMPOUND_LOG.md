## 2026-04-06 · [memory-review] · PR #[pending]
**Author:** GitHub Copilot · **Track:** backend + frontend · **Spec:** docs/specs/03_memory_system.md, docs/specs/04_backend_integration.md, docs/specs/05_frontend_ux.md

### What Changed
- Hardened the recap memory-review path so frontend fallback data no longer reintroduces approved or discarded memories as pending candidates.
- Reduced unnecessary Mem0 detail hydration for `status=pending_review` by honoring the local review metadata overlay before deciding whether a per-memory fetch is needed.
- Switched dev auth bypass away from the tracked `dev-user` default to avoid booting local sessions on top of seeded runtime artifacts.
- Added backend and frontend regression coverage for the fallback filtering and overlay-driven hydration paths.

### What We Learned
- Mem0 is not a reliable immediate source of truth for review metadata; the local review metadata store has to drive recap moderation semantics.
- Status-filtered review endpoints can silently turn into N+1 Mem0 traffic if overlay state is ignored before hydration.
- A fallback route that broadens its source query must still preserve the original semantic contract; otherwise the UI revives already-reviewed candidates.
- Committing runtime `users/` artifacts makes full-branch IDE review significantly heavier and requires a neutral dev-bypass user default.

### CLAUDE.md Updates
- Added pitfalls covering overlay-first `pending_review` hydration, recap fallback filtering, and neutral dev bypass defaults when runtime user artifacts are tracked.

## 2026-04-09 · [frontend-validation-and-auth-smoke] · PR #[pending]
**Author:** GitHub Copilot · **Track:** frontend · **Spec:** docs/specs/05_frontend_ux.md, docs/specs/06_implementation_spec.md

### What Changed
- Added a dedicated non-bypass Better Auth smoke path for browser validation and confirmed it passes locally.
- Fixed the journal saved-memory edit/delete path for `local:` review-backed memory IDs and revalidated the browser flow.
- Stabilized recap polling behavior for recently ended sessions so the live recap/journal flow and recap hook coverage pass again.
- Documented the current frontend validation baseline in `frontend/README.md`, including which deployment-oriented checks are green and which legacy UI unit suites still fail.
- Revalidated the deploy-oriented frontend gate locally: `pnpm lint` passes with warnings only, `pnpm typecheck` passes, and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=local-dev-secret pnpm build` passes.

### What We Learned
- The frontend auth smoke must run against a fresh non-bypass Next server; reusing an existing bypass-enabled dev server gives a false result.
- The live frontend E2E suite is stack-dependent: LangGraph, gateway, voice server, and frontend all need to be up for `pnpm test:e2e:live` to be meaningful.
- The remaining red `pnpm test` suites are expectation drift in older UI tests, not evidence that the newly validated auth/recap/journal/live-voice paths are broken.
- For Render/Vercel readiness on this branch, the strongest production-facing gate is `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=... pnpm build`.
- Better Auth accepts the local build secret for validation, but the build warns correctly if the secret is short or low-entropy; production deploys should replace it with a generated secret.

## 2026-04-09 · [frontend-auth-postgres-cleanup] · PR #[pending]
**Author:** GitHub Copilot · **Track:** frontend · **Spec:** docs/specs/06_implementation_spec.md

### What Changed
- Removed stale frontend signals that implied Better Auth still ran on SQLite.
- Clarified in `frontend/.env.example` that frontend auth now uses Postgres.
- Audited remaining SQLite references and confirmed the runtime path is Postgres-backed while lockfile references persist through Better Auth optional dependencies.

### What We Learned
- Removing ignore rules before deleting local auth artifacts can expose a local SQLite database that still contains live session and OAuth material.
- Cleaning the manifest alone is not enough to remove SQLite from the dependency story; `pnpm-lock.yaml` can still resolve `better-sqlite3` as an optional Better Auth dependency.
- Frontend auth migration state should be documented in both repo memory and committed env examples, otherwise future debugging falls back to stale SQLite assumptions.

## 2026-04-09 · [voice-e2e-hardening] · PR #[pending]
**Author:** GitHub Copilot · **Track:** frontend + voice · **Spec:** docs/specs/04_backend_integration.md, docs/specs/05_frontend_ux.md, docs/specs/06_implementation_spec.md

### What Changed
- Restored dev-bypass compatibility for hardened user-scoped frontend routes by returning a synthetic `dev-bypass-token` when local bypass is enabled without a backend cookie or configured fallback token.
- Fixed `frontend/src/app/hooks/useStreamVoiceSession.ts` so React Strict Mode cleanup no longer leaves the hook permanently destroyed, and relaxed voice readiness from exact remote session-id matching to remote participant presence in the joined one-on-one call.
- Stabilized the retry/update effect in `frontend/src/app/companion-runtime/voice-runtime.ts` by depending on stable derived primitives instead of the whole `voiceState` object, eliminating the browser-side update-depth loop.
- Added regressions for the dev-bypass token path, Strict Mode cleanup behavior, and remote-participant readiness, then revalidated with targeted Vitest, `pnpm typecheck`, targeted ESLint, a direct browser probe, and the live Playwright voice plus text→voice→text specs.

### What We Learned
- Hardening route auth can silently break local E2E if dev bypass no longer produces a backend token; the first symptom is often a stalled session bootstrap rather than an explicit auth error.
- In the Stream one-on-one voice flow, exact voice-agent session-id matching is too brittle as a frontend readiness gate; remote participant presence is the reliable signal that allows transcript and artifact custom events to flow.
- React Strict Mode effect cleanup can poison async startup refs if setup does not explicitly reset them on remount.
- When backend voice logs show transcript/custom-event traffic but the browser still times out, inspect the frontend capture bridge before touching STT/TTS; readiness gating and client-side render loops can drop an otherwise healthy turn.

## 2026-04-09 · [user-scoped-auth-hardening] · PR #[pending]
**Author:** GitHub Copilot · **Track:** backend + frontend · **Spec:** docs/specs/04_backend_integration.md, docs/specs/05_frontend_ux.md, docs/specs/06_implementation_spec.md

### What Changed
- Added a local Better Auth-backed compatibility bridge under `frontend/src/app/api/v1/auth/*` plus `frontend/src/server/legacy-backend-auth.ts`, so local auth validation no longer depends on the missing legacy `:8000` auth service.
- Updated backend gateway auth to prefer `SOPHIA_AUTH_BACKEND_URL`, and updated `scripts/sophia-e2e.ps1` plus frontend auth helpers so both frontend token minting and gateway validation hit the same local bridge.
- Hardened active user-scoped frontend routes to use user-scoped auth helpers instead of broad server fallback, including `resume`, `privacy/*`, `sophia/[userId]/voice/*`, `bootstrap/*`, `companion/invoke`, `conversation/*`, `sessions/*`, `usage/*`, `ws-ticket`, and the `api/chat` backend client path.
- Removed the remaining `api/chat` trust on client-supplied `user_id` by deriving canonical user identity from Better Auth server-side before forwarding backend chat requests.
- Added regression coverage for the auth bridge round-trip, sync-backend canonical user binding, voice/session proxy auth, ws-ticket auth, and the chat handler path that now ignores client `user_id`.

### What We Learned
- Restoring end-to-end auth confidence required more than reviving `/api/v1/auth/me`; the minted backend token has to carry the same canonical `session.user.id` that the gateway compares against path `user_id`.
- “Generic” proxy routes are easy to misclassify. Conversation history, bootstrap opener/status, usage, websocket ticketing, and companion invoke all operate on the current user and should not inherit `BACKEND_API_KEY` fallback semantics.
- The remaining active broad-auth route after cleanup is `frontend/src/app/api/community/latest-learning/route.ts`, which is intentionally treated as optional curated content rather than a user-scoped data surface; `_archived_session/bootstrap` remains excluded as archived code.
- The right fix for `api/chat` was not only swapping auth helpers; it also required removing the last server-side acceptance of client-provided `user_id` from the chat request pipeline.

## 2026-04-10 · [auth-runtime-cleanup-and-voice-connect-fix] · PR #[pending]
**Author:** GitHub Copilot · **Track:** backend + frontend + voice · **Spec:** docs/specs/04_backend_integration.md, docs/specs/05_frontend_ux.md, docs/specs/06_implementation_spec.md

### What Changed
- Verified the remaining local auth regressions were caused by process-scoped E2E bypass variables leaking into the live frontend and gateway runtime, then restarted both services in a clean environment with the bypass flags removed.
- Confirmed the backend auth path now stays scoped to backend-only bypass variables while the frontend keeps its public dev-bypass handling isolated to local UI behavior.
- Diagnosed the mic blink-and-stop failure to the gateway generating voice `call_id` values directly from mixed-case Better Auth user IDs, which violated the voice server contract that only allows lowercase `a-z`, digits, `_`, and `-`.
- Patched `backend/app/gateway/routers/voice.py` to sanitize the user-derived `call_id` fragment before dispatching the voice session, and added regression coverage in `backend/tests/test_voice_gateway.py` for mixed-case user IDs.
- Revalidated the targeted voice gateway suite locally (`24 passed`) and reran the deploy-oriented frontend checks: `pnpm lint` with warnings only, `pnpm typecheck`, and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=local-dev-secret pnpm build`.

### What We Learned
- Public E2E bypass flags do not need to be persisted at the OS level to break local auth; a contaminated shell is enough to split frontend identity from gateway identity.
- A successful `/voice/connect` response is not proof that live voice bootstrapped correctly; the downstream voice session creation can still fail and leave the frontend with a brief start-stop blink.
- Better Auth user IDs are not safe to reuse as downstream transport identifiers without normalization because external systems may impose stricter character contracts.
- The strongest local release signal for this branch remains targeted backend tests plus frontend lint, typecheck, and production build, while backend repo-wide lint is still blocked by unrelated pre-existing issues.
